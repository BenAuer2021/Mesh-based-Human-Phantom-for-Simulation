# **MESH-BASED HUMAN (XCAT) PHANTOMS FOR SIMULATION (mesh50_XCAT)**

The **M**esh-based **XCAT** phantom (**mesh50_XCAT**) is developed and maintained by Auer Benjamin from the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.

**Contacts:** bauer@bwh.harvard.edu.

The **mesh50_XCAT** phantom is based on the 4D extended cardiac-torso digital anthropomorphic ([XCAT](https://otc.duke.edu/industry-investors/available-technologies/xcat/)) human phantom for a 50<sup>th</sup> percentile American male based on the [PeopleSize anthropometric database](https://openerg.com/).

The author acknowledge that the distribution free of charge of the **mesh50_XCAT** phantom is kindly permitted by the original developer team of the XCAT phantom.

# 1. Objective and Background

###### Objective
> The **mesh50_XCAT** phantom provides realistic description of the human body for use in medical research, such as imaging, dosimetry, or radiation therapy. Simulation of such phantoms via adequate software capable of modelling mesh-based structures can emulate realistic medical data close to those obtained for actual patients.

###### Background
The Geant4 application for tomographic emission (GATE) remains one of the most commonly used simulation toolkits for medical research - [GATE source page](http://www.opengatecollaboration.org) [^1]. GATE supports the simulation of Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), optical, and Compton camera imaging, radiation therapy, and dosimetry in the same environment [^2]. 

Most of the simulation software allows building system and phantom geometries based on the combination of simple idealized volumes (i.e. primitives). However, primitives are limited to model accurately complex geometries. Recent GATE releases (version [8 and 9](http://www.opengatecollaboration.org)) alleviate these limitations by allowing the users to import triangulated surface meshes as stereo-lithography (STL) file format, thus enabling improved accuracy of simulation of phantom geometries.

Taking advantage of such capability, we developed an STL-based version of the XCAT digitial anthropomorphic phantom[^3][^4], named **mesh50_XCAT**, which provides an advanced anatomical description of the human body for simulation purposes.

In agreement with the original developer team of the XCAT phantom, we distribute below free of charge (*see attached files*) three versions of the **mesh50_XCAT** phantom with different lengths (**Head only**, **Head-Torso-Abdominal only**, and **Whole Body**). We provide below a detailled description of the usage in GATE of the phantoms. It is understandable that the **mesh50_XCAT** phantom can be used in any software capable of importing STL files (e.g. Geant4).

We refer readers interested on the generation, usage, and validation of the **mesh50_XCAT** phantom in the context of brain SPECT imaging to our previous publications. We kindly ask users to cite the following publications in their work,

# 2. Description

## 2.1 STL-based phantoms (**mesh50_XCAT**)

We provide 3 versions of the **mesh50_XCAT** phantom with different lengths (**Whole Body**, **Head-Torso-Abdominal Only**, and **Head Only**) as showed on the figure below.

The 3 **mesh50_XCAT** phantom versions consist of the following structures,

- **Whole Body:**<br/>
  *Body, Brain, Skeleton, Liver, Lungs, Air Cavity and Bronchi Tree*. Note, the *Air Cavity* volume was generated by merging part of the throat, nasal and oral cavities, and trachea. These volumes were embedded into a structure, named *Body* reflecting the outer surface of the phantom. Body was generated by unification of the head, ears, chest, arms, and legs into a single volume.

## 2.2 Voxelized version of the STL-based phantoms

We also provide voxelized versions in interfile format (*16-bit unsigned integer, \*.i33 for raw data and \*.h33 for the header files*) of the 3 STL-based (**mesh50_XCAT**) phantoms described above. The voxelized phantoms can be used in attenuation correction for SPECT or PET reconstruction or as attenuation media or activity sources for GATE simulation.

<p align="center">
<img width="1201" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-05 at 2 51 39 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84809217/172066089-1b02d124-c95c-4026-87d2-d52d7747ccf1.png">
</p>

The *Body, Air Cavity, Brain, Bronchi Tree, Liver, Lungs, and Skeleton* regions were set of values from 1 to 7 by increment of 1.

The STL-based (**mesh50_XCAT**) phantoms were converted into voxelized phantoms following an approach similar to the one described in this paper[^7]. 

The voxelized attenuation phantoms were generated for a voxel size of 1 mm<sup>3</sup>. The Whole Body voxelized phantom is of 658x280x1764 mm<sup>3</sup> (size of 650 MB). The Head-Torso-Abdominal Only phantom is of 658x280x956 mm<sup>3</sup> (size of 352 MB). The Head Only phantom is of 338x248x256 mm<sup>3</sup> (size of 43 MB).

# 3. Usage in GATE

## 3.1 STL-based phantoms (**mesh50_XCAT**)

We provide a macro *'GateSTLPhantoms.mac'* to load and simulate in GATE the STL-based (**mesh50_XCAT**) attenuation phantoms along with the voxelized source defined above. 

We desribe the GATE command lines to import the whole-body **mesh50_XCAT** phantom. Importation process is similar for the *Head* and *Head-Torso-Abdominal* **mesh50_XCAT** phantoms. All the **mesh50_XCAT** internal structures (*Skeleton, Liver, Lungs, Bronchi Tree, Brain, and Air Cavity*) are part of the *Body* volume. The *Body* volume can be set as a sub-volume of the *world* or *SPECTHead*, or any other volumes emcompassing its size. Examples of biological material composition from the [**ICRP**](https://www.icrp.org) and the [**ICRU**](https://www.icru.org) of the STL-based human structures are provided below ([Geant4 ICRP110_HumanPhantoms Example](https://gitlab.physik.uni-kiel.de/geant4/geant4/-/blob/dab42d20185975fb0910dadfc6aa9998d9d9e06d/examples/advanced/ICRP110_HumanPhantoms/src/ICRP110PhantomMaterial_Male.cc), [GATE Example](https://github.com/OpenGATE/GateContrib/blob/master/dosimetry/Radiotherapy/example2/data/GateMaterials.db)).

## 3.2 Voxelized version of the STL-based phantoms

The voxelized phantoms (interfile format) can be loaded in GATE via the following command lines, where *'VoxSource'* is the source volume name,
```ruby
/gate/source/addSource                                            VoxSource voxel
/gate/source/VoxSource/reader/insert                              image
/gate/source/VoxSource/imageReader/translator/insert              linear
/gate/source/VoxSource/imageReader/linearTranslator/setScale      0.001 Bq
/gate/source/VoxSource/imageReader/readFile PATH_TO/VoxWholeBody_658x280x1764.h33 
# OR Head_Assembled_338x248x256 OR HeadTorsoAbd_Assembled_658x280x956
/gate/source/VoxSource/imageReader/verbose 1
/gate/source/VoxSource/gps/particle gamma
/gate/source/VoxSource/gps/angtype iso
/gate/source/VoxSource/gps/energy 140.5 keV # For Tc-99m
```
The default position of the voxelized source is in the 1<sup>st</sup> quarter, so the voxelized source has to be shifted over half its dimension in the negative direction on each axis. As the voxel size is 1 mm<sup>3</sup>, dimensions of the image (*provided in the file name*) need to be divided by two along X, Y, Z dimensions.

This results in the addition of the following two lines,

```ruby
/gate/source/VoxSource/setPosition -329.0 -140.0 -882.0 mm
/gate/source/list
```

The voxelized phantoms can also be used as attenuation map in GATE via the following command lines. Note, the voxelized phantom should **A)** not collide with any other system components and **B)** be contained entirely within its *'mother'* volume. The voxelized phantom can be a sub-volume of the *SPECThead* volume as shown below, 
```ruby
/gate/SPECThead/daughters/name VoxAttn
/gate/SPECThead/daughters/insert ImageRegularParametrisedVolume
/gate/VoxAttn/geometry/setImage PATH_TO/VoxWholeBody_658x280x1764.h33
/gate/VoxAttn/geometry/setRangeToMaterialFile AttnRange.dat
/gate/VoxAttn/placement/setTranslation  0. 0. 0. mm
/gate/VoxAttn/setSkipEqualMaterials 1
/gate/VoxAttn/attachPhantomSD
```
Indices in the voxelized image are translated into biological materials via the parameters defined in the *'AttnRange.dat'* file. For example, we recommend the following indices to materials conversion,

  | Image Indices | Human Structures | Biological materials |
  |    :---     |     :---:  |     :---:     |
  | 0 |  Volume surrounding the body region of the phantom  | *Air* |
  | 1   | Body  | *Water*  |
  | 2   | Air Cavity  | *Air*  | 
  | 3   | Brain  | *Brain*  |
  | 4   | Bronchi Tree  | *Air*  |
  | 5   | Liver  | *Liver*  |
  | 6   | Lungs  | *Lung*  |  
  | 7   | Skeleton  | *SpineBone*  |  
  
  Note, the biological materials are defined in the *'GateMaterials.db'* file available for download (*GATE_macros.zip*).

# 3. Clinical Digital Activity Phantoms

We provide multiple activity phantoms to simulate clinical distribution for brain perfusion, brain DaT, bone and thyroid imaging.

<a name="BrainPerfusion"></a>
## [3.1. Brain Perfusion](#BrainPerfusion)

### 3.1.1 Description

We provide the voxelized brain perfusion activity phantom in interfile format (*16-bit unsigned integer, \*.i33 for raw data and \*.h33 for the header files*). The brain perfusion phantom can emulate a clinical <sup>99mTc</sup> ECD/HMPAO or <sup>123I</sup>-IMP brain perfusion distribution as imaged 1h post injection. It can be used in combination of the voxelized or STL attenuation Head-Torso-Abdominal **mesh50_XCAT** phantoms described in the previous section. The brain perfusion activity phantom is co-registered with these attenuation phantom, thus no translation in GATE for simulation is needed to align the activity and attenuation phantoms.

The brain perfusion activity phantom can be simulated (**VoxHeadTorsoAbd_BrainPerfusion_Source_658x280x956.i33**) as being filled with uniform tracer activity in striatum:grey matter:white matter : lungs : liver : background with concentration ratio of 10.1:9.3:2.3:6.0:11.4:1. It consists of 658x280x956 voxels of 1.0x1.0x1.0 mm<sup>3</sup> (size of 352.3 MB).
  
<a name="SourceI123"></a>
## [3.2.2 Usage in GATE](#SourceI123)

The voxelized phantoms (*interfile format*) can be loaded in GATE via the following command lines for a <sup>99m</sup>Tc or <sup>123</sup>I sources, where *'VoxSource'* is the source volume name,
```ruby
/gate/source/addSource VoxSource voxel

/gate/source/VoxSource/setPosition -329.0 -140.0 -478.0 mm
/gate/source/VoxSource/dump 1
```
The default position of the voxelized source is in the 1<sup>st</sup> quarter, so the voxelized source has to be shifted over half its dimension in the negative direction on each axis. As the voxel size is 1 mm<sup>3</sup>, dimensions of the image (*provided in the file name*) need to be divided by two along X, Y, Z dimensions.

The following example shows how to define a source of <sup>123</sup>I gammas. The gamma emission data is from the IAEA database: https://www-nds.iaea.org/relnsd/vcharthtml/VChartHTML.html.
Note that this example shows the gamma emissions only, so the simulation output will be missing the X-ray peaks seen in true <sup>123</sup>I spectra.

## 4.2 Brain Dopamine DaT

### 4.2.1 Description

We provide the voxelized brain DaT activity phantom in interfile format (*16-bit unsigned integer, \*.i33 for raw data and \*.h33 for the header files*). The brain DaT phantom can emulate a clinical <sup>123I</sup>-Ioflupane brain dopamine distribution as imaged 4h post injection. It can be used in combination of the voxelized or STL attenuation Head-Torso-Abdominal **mesh50_XCAT** phantoms described in the previous section. The brain perfusion activity phantom is co-registered with these attenuation phantom, thus no translation in GATE for simulation is needed to align the activity and attenuation phantoms.

For additional information, please see below references,

</p>

The brain DaT activity phantom can be simulated (**VoxHeadTorsoAbd_DaT_Source_658x280x956.i33**) as being filled with uniform tracer activity in striatum : salivary glands : lungs : liver : background with concentration ratio of 8:4:1.8:6.2:1, respectively. It consists of 658x280x956 voxels of 1.0x1.0x1.0 mm<sup>3</sup> (size of 352.3 MB).

### 4.2.2 Usage in GATE

The voxelized phantoms (*interfile format*) can be loaded in GATE via the following command lines for a <sup>123</sup>I source, where *'VoxSource'* is the source volume name,
```ruby
/gate/source/addSource VoxSource voxel
/gate/source/VoxSource/reader/insert image
/gate/source/VoxSource/imageReader/translator/insert linear
/gate/source/VoxSource/imageReader/linearTranslator/setScale 0.03 Bq

An example of a complete source of <sup>123</sup>I gammas consisting of all the gammas emissions can be found in the [previous section](SourceI123).

## 4.3 Thyroid

### 4.3.1 Description

We provide the voxelized thyroid activity phantoms in interfile format (*16-bit unsigned integer, \*.i33 for raw data and \*.h33 for the header files*). The thyroid phantoms can emulate a clinical <sup>123</sup>I or <sup>131</sup>I thyroid distribution with and without background activity. It can be used in combination of the voxelized or STL attenuation Head-Torso-Abdominal **mesh50_XCAT** phantoms described in the previous section. The brain perfusion activity phantom is co-registered with these attenuation phantom, thus no translation in GATE for simulation is needed to align the activity and attenuation phantoms.

<p align="center">
<img width="800" alt="Screen Shot 2023-06-21 at 1 12 02 AM" src="https://github.com/BenAuer2021/Mesh-based-Human-Phantom-for-Simulation/assets/84809217/0988bdf8-b9c4-4a37-bd9e-48ae64177674">
</p>

The thyroid activity phantom can be simulated (**VoxHeadTorsoAbd_Thyroid_Source_658x280x956.i33**) as being filled with uniform tracer activity in thyroid : salivary glands : background with concentration ratios of 8:5:1, respectively. We provide as well the thyroid phantom without background activity (**VoxHeadTorsoAbd_Thyroid_NoBkg_Source_658x280x956.i33**). Both phantom consist of 658x280x956 voxels of 1.0x1.0x1.0 mm<sup>3</sup> (size of 352.3 MB).

### 4.3.2 Usage in GATE

The voxelized phantoms (*interfile format*) can be loaded in GATE via the following command lines for a <sup>99m</sup>Tc source, where *'VoxSource'* is the source volume name,
```ruby
/gate/source/addSource VoxSource voxel

/gate/source/VoxSource/setPosition -329.0 -140.0 -478.0 mm
/gate/source/VoxSource/dump 1
```
An example of a complete source of <sup>123</sup>I gammas consisting of all the gammas emissions can be found in the [brain perfusion section](SourceI123). The following example shows how to define a source of <sup>131</sup>I gammas. The gamma emission data is from the IAEA database: https://www-nds.iaea.org/relnsd/vcharthtml/VChartHTML.html. Note that this example shows the gamma emissions only, so the simulation output will be missing the X-ray peaks or beta emissions seen in true <sup>131</sup>I energy spectra. 

`VS_gamma` is the name of the voxelised gamma source

It can be used in combination of the voxelized or STL attenuation whole-body **mesh50_XCAT** phantoms described in the above. The bone activity phantom is co-registered with these attenuation phantom, thus no translation in GATE for simulation is needed to align the activity and attenuation phantoms.

The bone activity phantom can be simulated (**VoxWholeBody_Bone_Source_658x280x1764.i33**) as being filled with uniform tracer activity in bone : background with concentration ratios of 8:1, respectively. It consists of 1764 voxels of 1.0x1.0x1.0 mm<sup>3</sup> (size of 650 MB).

### 4.4.2 Usage in GATE

The voxelized phantoms (*interfile format*) can be loaded in GATE via the following command lines for a <sup>99m</sup>Tc source, where *'VoxSource'* is the source volume name,
```ruby
